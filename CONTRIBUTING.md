## Submitting an issue

_Note: Please see our [security policy][security-policy] to report a potential
vulnerability rather than using the public issue queue._

## Pull request workflow

We follow the [GitHub flow][github-flow] workflow for project development.

> GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful
> for everyone, not just developers.

1. Check out the `main` branch and pull down the latest code
1. Create a new branch off of the latest from `main` using a short, descriptive 
branch name (e.g. `update-code-of-conduct`) 
1. Make your code changes
1. When you are ready to have your changes reviewed, push your code to GitHub
   and open a pull request. Make sure to complete all sections of the pull
   request template.
1. Wait for automated checks to complete and address any failures.
1. Once all automated checks have passed, a maintainer will review your changes.
1. After your pull request has been approved, it will be merged. We utilize
   GitHub's squash and merge method in order to maintain a cleaner commit
   tree.
