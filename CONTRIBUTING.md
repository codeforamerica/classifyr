# How to contribute

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! In this guide
you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue,
creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting Started

### 1a. Create a new issue

If you find a problem with the project, [search if an issue already exists][1].
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue][2].

### 1b. Finding an issue to fix

Scan through our [existing issues][1] to find one that interests you. If you find
an unassigned issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### 2. Open a PR

We follow a very simple development workflow:
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

> GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful
> for everyone, not just developers.

1. Check out the `main` branch and pull down the latest code.
1. Create a new branch off of the latest from `main` prefixed with your initials:
   td-new-feature.
1. Work on your feature.
1. When you're done with your feature, create a pull request and request a
   review from another developer. Please follow the pull request template.
   Opening a PR will automatically run the tests and linting, make sure
   everything is passing.
1. Fix up your PR if needed and "squash and merge" it once approved.

### 3. Your PR has been merged!

Thank you and congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The Classifyr team thanks you!
