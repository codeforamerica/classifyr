# README

Data classification tool developed for the Reimagine911 project.

## System Requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started.

- **Ruby**: Version 3.1.2 as specified in the `.ruby-version` file.
- **Bundler**: Version 2.3.7+.
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12+.

For reference, the project is using Rails 7.

## Quick Start

You can set things up manually by going through this section or use Docker (see next section).

1. Pull the code

```
git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/classifyr.git && cd classifyr
```

2. Install dependencies

```
bundle install
```

3. Set up the database

```
rails db:prepare
```

4. Run the tests

```
rspec
```

5. Start the server

```
./bin/dev
```

## Docker

This project includes a Dockerfile for the web app as well as a docker compose
file that can be used to set up a full local stack for development and testing.
These configurations are based on the official [Docker documentation for'
rails][1].

You can launch the stack by running the commands below (assuming you have both
docker and [docker compose][2] installed).

If you are using a rootless docker alternative, you will first need to create
the database directory by running the following:

```bash
mkdir tmp/db
```

_Note: This has been tested on Intel Mac using both Docker Desktop and
[colima][3]._

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Note: It may take a few minutes for all services to be available.
docker compose run web rake db:prepare
docker compose run web rake assets:precompile
```

You should then be able to connect to the classifyr via http://localhost:3000/.

## Tests (how to run)

Use the following command to run the tests:

```
rspec
```

```
Finished in 0.86675 seconds (files took 2.32 seconds to load)
11 examples, 0 failures
```

## Linting

We use Rubocop with a [custom config](.rubocop.yml) for linting. Run the following command to check the code:

```
rubocop
```

Add `-a` or `-A` to automatically fix correctable issues.

## Deployment

The live development environment is accessible at https://development.nprd.classifyr.org/.

## Accessing the development Rails console

### Requirements

- The AWS CLI (version 2.7+). Check out this [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) if needed.
- You will need an AWS account created by the Code for America team to do this.
- Your account needs to have MFA set up.

### Steps

You will first need to establish a [temporary session using your MFA device](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/). To do so, replace the `MFA_ARN` and `MFA_CODE` in the command below.

MFA_ARN (from [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/)): If you're using an MFA hardware device, then the value is similar to `GAHT12345678`. If you're using a virtual MFA, then the value is similar to `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`.

MFA_CODE: A temporary authentication code provided by your MFA device.

```
aws sts get-session-token --serial-number MFA_ARN --token-code MFA_CODE
```

This will give you temporary credentials that you can set as environment variables or create an aws profile for. See [AWS docs for details](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/).

First, retrieve the ARN from one of the running tasks in the dev env:

```
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster r911-development-web --region us-east-1
```

This will return one or more task ARNs similar to "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task/r911-development-web/111111111111111111111111111111111". The string after the final slash (in this example, "111111111111111111111111111111111") is the task id.

You can then use this ID with the following command (replace TASK_ID with the actual ID):

```
aws ecs execute-command --cluster r911-development-web --region us-east-1 --task TASK_ID  --interactive --command "rails console"
```

Note: If `aws` complains about `execute-command` not being a valid command, be sure to upgrade to the latest version of `aws-cli` (should be 2.7+). You can check your version with `aws --version`.
